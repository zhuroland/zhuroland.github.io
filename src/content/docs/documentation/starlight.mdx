## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

<FileTree>
- public/
- src/
	- assets/
	- content/
		- docs/
		- config.ts
	- env.d.ts
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
</FileTree>

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
